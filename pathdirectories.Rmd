# Paths and directories

* The path of a file/directory is its **location/address** in the file system.

* Your home directory is the one that hosts your personal folder:
	+ for CRG users: **/nfs/users/[yourgroup]/[yourusername]**

## Tree of directories

<br>
<font size="12"> <b>~</b></font>: shortcut to the home directory
<br>
<font size="12"> <b>.</b></font>: current directory
<br>
<font size="12"> <b>..</b></font>: one directory up the tree


## Navigate the tree of directory with the R terminal

* Get the path of the current directory (know where you are working at the moment) with <b>getwd</b> (get working directory):
```{r, eval=FALSE}	
getwd()
```

* Change working directory with **setwd** (set working directory)<br>
Go to a directory giving the absolute path: 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("~/Rcourse")
```
Go to a directory giving the relative path:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("Module1")
```
You are now in: "~/Rcourse/Module1"
<br>
Move one directory "up" the tree:
```{r, eval=FALSE} 
setwd("..")
```
You are now in: "~/Rcourse"
